# About Our Idea ðŸ’¡

Over the past few years, there has been a substantial rise in the number of transactions that occur on our accounts. This can be attributed to the digitization of 
banking transactions, our changing needs, or any other. Further, these are sometimes ad hoc payments for various purchases, done online or using other digital
means, or recurring payments such as EMIs, utility payments, subscriptions, and a few others. According to a recent study by digital payments firm PhonePe and Boston Consulting Group (BCG), 40% of all transactions in India are digital, and Indiaâ€™s digital payment market led by UPI payments is expected to more than triple to $10 trillion by 2026.

The same report highlights frauds and UPI outages as possible bottlenecks in the growing acceptance digital payments. Such technical bottlenecks make it necessary for customers to monitor their accounts, routinely and ensure there are no dubious or unexpected debit
transactions.

Aligned with the contest objectives, this idea aims to improve reporting capabilities, innovate to build GREEN financial tools, products, reporting capabilities to create relevant sustainabilty solutions & enhance customer engagement.

For retail banking customers, who are tech-savvy, have a high volume of transactions and lead a busy routine, this product "Account Insights" would perform an automated review of all their accounts held with different institutions and highlight doubtful, duplicate, auto-debit and other such transactions of their concern on one platform that would save them time and effort spent on manually reviewing and identifying these.
